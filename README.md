# Real-Time Fleet Management Dashboard
A full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world logistics dashboard for monitoring a fleet of vehicles in real-time. This project demonstrates a modern, scalable architecture using C#, .NET, Entity Framework Core, and modern frontend technologies.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Live Vehicle Tracking**: View the real-time location of all vehicles on an interactive map.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Vehicle information cards in the sidebar update instantly with status and location changes.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes SignalR with WebSockets to push live data from the server to the client, eliminating the need for polling.
- **Persistent Data**: Vehicle data and locations are stored in a SQLite database, managed by Entity Framework Core.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and responsive user interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **Automated Database Setup**: The application automatically creates and seeds the database on first launch using EF Core Migrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
**Backend:**
- C# & ASP.NET Core
- SignalR (for real-time web functionality)

**Database:**
- SQLite
- Entity Framework Core (as the Object-Relational Mapper)

**Frontend:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Leaflet.js (for the interactive map)

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- .NET 6 SDK (or newer)

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamgupta04/Real-Time-Fleet-Tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Real-Time-Fleet-Tracker/Backend
   ```

3. Install EF Core tools (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
   ```

4. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

6. The application will automatically create the fleet.db database, apply migrations, and seed the initial data.

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
This project follows a classic 3-Tier Architecture:

- **Data Tier (SQLite & EF Core)**: The DataContext.cs file and EF Core migrations define the database schema and handle all data persistence.
- **Logic Tier (ASP.NET Core & C#)**: The backend server handles all business logic. A VehicleSimulator background service simulates vehicle movement, and a LocationHub (SignalR) pushes real-time updates to clients.
- **Presentation Tier (HTML, CSS, JS)**: A single-page application (SPA) style frontend that connects to the SignalR hub to receive and display live data on an interactive map without page reloads.
